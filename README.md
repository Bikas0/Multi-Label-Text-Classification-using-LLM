<h1>Multi-Label Text Classification using LLM</h1>

This project implements a multi-label text classification system using a Large Language Model (LLM). Multi-label text classification is the task of assigning multiple labels or tags to a given text based on its content. This is particularly useful in applications such as categorizing news articles, tagging customer support tickets, and organizing scientific papers.<br>

<h3>Features</h3>
<b>Multi-label Support:</b> Classify text into multiple categories, enabling a more nuanced understanding and categorization.<br>
<b>Large Language Model Utilization:<\b> Leverage the power of state-of-the-art LLMs to handle complex language patterns and provide accurate classifications.<br>
<b>Scalable and Flexible:</b> Easily adaptable to different datasets and classification tasks with minimal modifications.<br>
